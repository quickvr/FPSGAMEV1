Video Script: Creating a First-Person Shooter with JavaScript on GitHub

[Intro Scene]

(Upbeat music plays)

[On-Screen Text]: "Create a First-Person Shooter with JavaScript!"

[Host On-Camera]: (Smiling and excited)

"Hey everyone! Welcome back to the channel. Today, we're diving into the world of game development and building a simple first-person shooter using JavaScript! We'll use mouse movement and the WASD keys to control our character. Plus, I'll show you how to set it all up on GitHub. So letâ€™s get started!"

[Scene Transition to Screen Share]

[On-Screen Text]: "Step 1: Set Up Your Project"

[Voiceover]:

"First, letâ€™s set up our project. Create a new folder on your computer for the game. Inside this folder, create three files: index.html, style.css, and script.js."

[Cut to Code Editor]

[Voiceover]:

"In index.html, weâ€™ll set up the basic structure. Letâ€™s start by creating the HTML skeleton."

(Shows typing)

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">

<head>

<meta charset="UTF-8">

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

<title>First-Person Shooter</title>

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

</head>

<body>

<canvas id="gameCanvas"></canvas>

<script src="script.js"></script>

</body>

</html>

[On-Screen Text]: "Step 2: Style the Game Canvas"

[Voiceover]:

"Now letâ€™s add some styles in style.css. Weâ€™ll make the canvas fill the screen."

(Shows typing)

body {

margin: 0;

overflow: hidden;

}

canvas {

display: block;

background: #333; /* Dark background for the game */

}

[On-Screen Text]: "Step 3: Set Up the Game Logic"

[Voiceover]:

"Next, weâ€™ll dive into the game logic in script.js. First, weâ€™ll set up the canvas and basic variables."

(Shows typing)

const canvas = document.getElementById('gameCanvas');

const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

canvas.width = window.innerWidth;

canvas.height = window.innerHeight;

let playerX = canvas.width / 2;

let playerY = canvas.height / 2;

let playerSpeed = 5;

let mouseX = canvas.width / 2;

let mouseY = canvas.height / 2;

document.addEventListener('mousemove', (event) => {

mouseX = event.clientX;

mouseY = event.clientY;

});

[On-Screen Text]: "Step 4: Handle Player Movement"

[Voiceover]:

"Now let's implement movement controls using the WASD keys."

(Shows typing)

const keys = {};

document.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {

keys[event.key] = true;

});

document.addEventListener('keyup', (event) => {

keys[event.key] = false;

});

function update() {

if (keys['w']) playerY -= playerSpeed;

if (keys['s']) playerY += playerSpeed;

if (keys['a']) playerX -= playerSpeed;

if (keys['d']) playerX += playerSpeed;

// Keep the player within bounds

playerX = Math.max(0, Math.min(canvas.width, playerX));

playerY = Math.max(0, Math.min(canvas.height, playerY));

}

[On-Screen Text]: "Step 5: Game Loop"

[Voiceover]:

"Letâ€™s create the main game loop to keep everything running."

(Shows typing)

function gameLoop() {

ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height); // Clear the canvas

// Update player position

update();

// Draw the player

ctx.fillStyle = 'white'; // Player color

ctx.fillRect(playerX, playerY, 20, 20); // Simple square to represent the player

requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop); // Request next frame

}

gameLoop(); // Start the game loop

[Scene Transition Back to Host On-Camera]

[Host]:

"Awesome! Now we have the basic functionality for our first-person shooter. You can move around using WASD keys and control the camera with your mouse!"

[On-Screen Text]: "Step 6: Upload to GitHub"

[Voiceover]:

"Finally, letâ€™s push this to GitHub. First, initialize a new Git repository in your project folder:"

(Shows terminal commands)

git init

git add .

git commit -m "Initial commit of first-person shooter"

"Next, create a new repository on GitHub and follow the instructions to link your local project to GitHub."

(Shows filling out GitHub repository)

[Voiceover]:

"After that, push your changes!"

git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git

git push -u origin master

[Host On-Camera]

[Host]:

"And there you go! Your very own first-person shooter hosted on GitHub. You can now expand upon this basic version by adding enemies, shooting mechanics, or even textures. The possibilities are endless!"
